# Express: Let's start building the Natours API!

Here we are finally starting to build the course big project (Natours). We are going to start by building the API and for this we are going to use Express.

## What is Express?

Express a minimal node.js framework, which means, it's actual built on top of node.js. Express is writen 100% using node.js code.

Express contains a very robusct set of features: complex routing, easier handling of requests and responses, middleware, server-side rendering, etc. arr allk included out of the box and this allow us to have a rapid development of node.js applciations: we don't have to re-invent the wheel.

Also express makes it easier to organize our application into the MVC architecture.
