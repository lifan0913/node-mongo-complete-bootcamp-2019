# Introdution to Node.js and NPM

The goal with this section is to get you (student) to write code with Node.js as fast as possible but without worrying to much about what's happening behind the scenes.

## What is Node.js and why use it?

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on google's open-source v8 JavaScript engine. Usually JavaScript runs on the browser, with Node we can take JavaScript and run it outside of the browser.

This means that we can use Node.js as a web server to build fast, highly scalable network application (back-end). Another pro to use Node.js is that we can use JavaScript across the entire stack which will result in a faster and more efficient development.

NPM: huge library of open-source packages available for everyone for free.

Possible uses to Node.js:

- API with database behind it (preferably NoSQL)
- Data streaming (think YouTube/Netflix)
- Real-time chat application
- Server-side web application

Don't use Node to develop applications with heavy server-side processing (CPU-intensive).

## Running JavaScript outside the browser

To start running Node code on the terminal just type `node`. Then we can start typing some JavaScript code directly on the terminal.
